      <h2>Privet!</h2>
      <p>I’m Petr.</p>
      <p>I hold a Ph.D. in Economics and a Candidate of Science in Finance (Russian Ph.D. equivalent). My research focuses on empirical economics and management, with a particular emphasis on data analysis across diverse fields such as intangibles economics and sports economics, including eSports. I utilize econometrics, machine learning, and natural language processing (NLP) methods to study these areas.</p>
      
      <p>I have published in prestigious journals including the <strong>European Journal of Operation Research</strong> (ABS 4), <strong>Journal of Business Ethics</strong> (FT50, ABS 3), and <strong>Journal of Economic Behavior and Organization</strong> (ABS 3), among others. My work has contributed to the understanding of the economic impact of various managerial practices and policies in both traditional and digital sectors.</p>
      
      <p>As the Head of the <a href="https://idlab.hse.ru/en/" target="_blank">International Laboratory of Intangible-driven Economy</a> at HSE University in Perm, I lead research initiatives aimed at bridging the gap between theory and practice in the field of intangible assets and their role in economic decision-making.</p>
      
      <p>I also have extensive consulting experience. For example, I have worked with major companies like Coca Cola, Sberbank, and Rostrud. My team's work with Coca Cola involved text mining for brand analysis, while our collaboration with Sberbank led to the development of an NLP model to predict ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) risks. For Rostrud, we designed and implemented an analytical system for data visualization.</p>
      
      <p>In addition to my research and consulting work, I am deeply involved in teaching and mentoring. I am passionate about educating the next generation of leaders in economics and data analysis, and I am always eager to collaborate on projects that leverage advanced computational methods to solve real-world problems.</p>
